# IDXBroker-GETs
Sample get calls for the IDX Broker API

Standard Disclaimer: This code is not official IDX Broker code. It does use their API, but in NO WAY is it supported by IDX Broker. DO NOT contact IDX Broker for any support of this code. 

Forks and Pull Requests Welcome!

All calls will be a simple call for leads. Endpoint used: https://api.idxbroker.com/leads/lead

Since the IDX Broker docs are all PHP I decided to create an example of a leads call in various other languages.

All request headers MUST be lower case (see ruby example). I do have a request in to make headers case insensitive.

Some requests may have package dependencies as well as needing other files (like a Gemfile.lock for example)

No version is specified.

No prefered output (json or xml) is specified.
